<h1>SOFIA</h1>
<p>The Speedrun Observer Following Incredible Avatars (S.O.F.I.A.) tracks levels of speedrunners in your guild.</p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/8iqYyis.png" />
<p>The list sorts players in your guild by their level and by the time they did level up: the highest level are on top of the list and, when two players have the same level, the player who was the first one to level up is on top.</p>
<p>The primary intent is to track <b>Hardcore</b> players who level up in a new guild or a fresh realm.</p>
<p><i>Known limitations</i></p>
<p>For now the addon can only track your guildmates.</p>
<p>Level up time is taken when you log in. If a player levels up when you are not connected, you will only be informed of this event next time you log in. Because of that, if you do not log in often enough, you may have inaccurate level up times.</p>
